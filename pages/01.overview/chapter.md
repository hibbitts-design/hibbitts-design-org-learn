# Overview

[Grav](http://getgrav.org) is a modern database-free CMS which stores content in a flexible and easy-to-access file structure, and when paired with the [Git Sync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync) plugin it's a perfect partner to take advantage of today’s modern ecosystem of open and collaborative services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or a local [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) server.
