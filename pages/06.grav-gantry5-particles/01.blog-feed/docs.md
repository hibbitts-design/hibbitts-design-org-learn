#### Download the Gantry 5 Particle
* Download and unzip the ['Blog Feed' Paticle](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-gantry5-particle-blog-feed/archive/master.zip).

#### Installing the Particle

Before installing and using the Particle, it is suggested you temporarily enable Gantry's [`Development Mode`](http://docs.gantry.org/gantry5/configure/extras)

1. Open the folder of your active Gantry theme. For example, if you are using the Hydrogen theme open the folder `/user/themes/g5_helium`.
2. If a `custom` folder already exists open it, otherwise create it.
3. If a `particles` folder already exists within the `custom` folder open it, otherwise create it.
4. Upload `blog_feed.html.twig` and `blog_feeds.yaml` files into the `/custom/particles` folder. For example, if you are using the Helium theme copy the two particle files into `/user/themes/g5_helium/custom/particles`.
