##### 3.6 Create a new repository in your chosen Git service (GitHub example shown)

!!! With GitHub's recent change of repository default branches being named 'main' instead of 'master' the following work-around is needed until GitHub also addresses automatic default branch re-routing:
!!! 1. Once you have created your new repo, create a new branch called 'Master'
!!! 2. Set the default branch of the repo to this newly created 'Master' branch

##### 3.7 Enter repository name
