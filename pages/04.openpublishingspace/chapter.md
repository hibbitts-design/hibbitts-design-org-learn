[Grav Open Publishing (Blogging) Space Space](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space) with [Git Sync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync) is designed to  help organizations or individual tech-savvy authors more easily publish, share and collaboratively edit Markdown-based blogs or Websites.

One or more Open Publishing Space pages can also be embedded into another system (i.e. LMS) with the 'Chromeless Pages' option, which hides global navigation elements.
